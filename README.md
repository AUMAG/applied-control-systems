Course notes for Applied Control Systems at Adelaide University

## Textbook

These course notes are not a comprehensive reference or set of lecture notes;
they are written to introduce and supplement the excellent text by Åström and Murray:
*[Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers](https://fbswiki.org/wiki/index.php/Feedback_Systems:_An_Introduction_for_Scientists_and_Engineers)*.

## Open source?

It's not clear to me if having my teaching material publicly available like this will bring any tangible benefits in the short term, but philosophically providing access to the source material is something I believe in very strongly.
By making it available like this, it becomes possible for students and others to examine, gain ideas from, fix errors, and (perhaps) suggest improvements.
