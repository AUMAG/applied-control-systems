	Abstract = {We have significantly simplified the IMC-PID tuning rules. These new rules cover the vast majority of control loops encountered in the chemical industry. This work is the result of a great deal of experience in successfully applying IMC-PID tuning rules and an effort to prepare a training course on controller tuning. The simplified rules are very similar in form to the classic open loop Ziegler-Nichols rules and use the process reaction curve method for process testing. The two differences are that these rules are based on a less aggressive performance criteria and that we adapt the rules for some commonly encountered special cases. This paper presents the relationship between the simplified IMC-PID rules, the general IMC-PID rules, the Ziegler-Nichols rules and the Cohen-Coon rules. We show that the simplified rules are less sensitive to parameter mis-estimation than other more aggressive tuning rules. We also proposed rules for a fourth action; filtering. Filtering is available in digital controllers and smart field transmitters. We report that filtering and derivative action cancel each other and therefore should not be used together. We briefly outline the contents of the tuning course and finish the paper with an industrial example where the simplified rules have been successfully applied.},

	Abstract = { Numerical methods are described for determining robust, or well-conditioned, solutions to the problem of pole assignment by state feedback. The solutions obtained are such that the sensitivity of the assigned poles to perturbations in the system and gain matrices is minimized. It is shown that for these solutions, upper bounds on the norm of the feedback matrix and on the transient response are also minimized and a lower bound on the stability margin is maximized. A measure is derived which indicates the optimal conditioning that may be expected for a particular system with a given set of closed-loop poles, and hence the suitability of the given poles for assignment. },

	Abstract = {Abstract
The classical regulator problem is posed in the context of linear, time-invariant, finite-dimensional systems with deterministic disturbance and reference signals. Control action is generated by a compensator which is required to provide closed loop stability and output regulation in the face of small variations in certain system parameters. It is shown, using the geometric approach, that such a structurally stable synthesis must utilize feedback of the regulated variable, and incorporate in the feedback path a suitably reduplicated model of the dynamic structure of the disturbance and reference signals. The necessity of this control structure constitutes the Internal Model Principle. It is shown that, in the frequency domain, the purpose of the internal model is to supply closed loop transmission zeros which cancel the unstable poles of the disturbance and reference signals. Finally, the Internal Model Principle is extended to weakly nonlinear systems subjected to step disturbances and reference signals.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present analytic rules for PID controller tuning that are simple and still result in good closed-loop behavior. The starting point has been the IMC-PID tuning rules that have achieved widespread industrial acceptance. The rule for the integral term has been modified to improve disturbance rejection for integrating processes. Furthermore, rather than deriving separate rules for each transfer function model, there is a just a single tuning rule for a first-order or second-order time delay model. Simple analytic rules for model reduction are presented to obtain a model in this form, including the ``half rule'' for obtaining the effective time delay.},
